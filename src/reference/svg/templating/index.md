# Template directives

SVG elements can be used as a template and are rendered following special attributes, named
directives, that define the final appearance of the graphic by dynamically evaluating the expression
and data.

The attributes for SVG templating are:

- [g-bind](g-bind.md) - set attributes value based on the data.
- [g-content](g-content.md) - insert content into the element.
- [g-for](g-for.md) - render the element multiple times based on the data.
- [g-if](g-if.md) - conditionally render an element based on the data.
- [g-on](g-on.md) - attach an event listener to the element.

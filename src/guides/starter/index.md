# What is Graphane?

Graphane is a **data visualization microframework** designed to facilitate the creation of dynamic and
interactive visualizations by :

- [**A web component**](./composer.md) for combine graphic, data and methods.
- [**SVG markup template**](./template.md).
- [**Data**](./data.md) with reactivity. 
- [**Methods**](./methods.md) to handle interactivity and data transformation.

The strength of Graphane is offers **flexibility in designs**, allowing creators to make unique
aesthetic visualizations that are far from becoming monotonous charts seen everywhere. Graphane is
based in SVG and directives, defining a **declarative way** for build data-driven graphics. This
approach allows centering the effort on the design in a very natural form. Designers and developers
achieve technical efficiency and gain the means to communicate their data story to their audience
effectively.

In addition, Graphane also ensuring **smooth rendering** and **optimal performance** with a **tiny
overhead**. It is not just a tool but a complete system that includes specially designed mechanisms
to update the visualization efficiently when data are changed. This feature allows Graphane to
maintain high runtime performance without pre-compilation processes.

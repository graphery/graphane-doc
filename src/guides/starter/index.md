# What is Graphane?

Graphane is a free and open-source **data visualization microframework** designed to facilitate the
creation of dynamic and interactive visualizations by :

- [**A web component**](./composer.md) for combining graphics, data, and methods.
- [**SVG markup template**](./template.md).
- [**Data**](./data.md) with reactivity.
- [**Methods**](./methods.md) to handle interactivity and data transformation.

The strength of Graphane is that it offers **flexibility in designs**, allowing creators to make
unique aesthetic visualizations that are far from becoming monotonous charts seen everywhere.
Graphane is based on SVG and directives, defining a **declarative way** to build data-driven
graphics. This approach allows centering the effort on the design in a very natural form. Designers
and developers achieve technical efficiency and gain the means to communicate their data story to
their audience effectively.

In addition, Graphane also ensures **smooth rendering** and **optimal performance** with a **tiny
overhead**. It is not just a tool but a complete system that includes specially designed mechanisms
to update the visualization efficiently when data are changed. This feature allows Graphane to
maintain high runtime performance without pre-compilation processes.

# Why to Use Web Components

Web Components is a suite of different standard technologies allowing you to create reusable custom
elements. Here are a few reasons why we consider the use of web components for Graphane:

## Encapsulation

Web components follow the concept of Shadow DOM that provides encapsulation. This means the styles
and scripts you add inside a web component cannot interfere with the rest of your document.

## Reusability

Web components are reusable across different web applications. A component you create is not tied to
a specific framework, so it can be used anywhere HTML is used.

## Interoperability

Web components can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML. Whether
you're using React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or simple HTML and JavaScript, web components are built to
be versatile.

## Standards-Based

Web components are based on existing web standards. Features to support web components are built
directly into the browser, rather than added on through libraries or frameworks.

## Runtime

Web components are run directly by the browser, reducing the need for extensive libraries,
transpiler, compilers, and builders.

## Performance

Since web components are native to the browser, they can offer excellent performance in comparison
to some JavaScript-heavy libraries or frameworks.

## Size

Web components tend to be less code-heavy, leading to smaller, more lightweight applications.

To sum up, using web components can bring efficiency and versatility, better performance and smaller
size to Graphane.

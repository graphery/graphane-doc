# Framework vs. Microframework

A framework and a microframework are software development models developers use to build
applications. They contain pre-written code that developers use as a basis for building their
solutions, thus quickening the development process. However, there are distinct differences between
the two.

## Framework

A Framework is a full-featured software development environment with pre-written, ready-to-use,
standardized code. This code can handle several everyday tasks, such as user authentication,
database management, and routing.

### Advantages of Frameworks

- Efficient Development Process: With most of the base work already covered, developers can focus on
  application logic rather than basic functionalities.
- Structured Environment: Frameworks enforce a coding discipline and a specific structure, which
  results in cleaner and easier-to-understand code.

### Disadvantages of Frameworks

- Learning Curve: Given their robustness, frameworks often have a steep learning curve.
- Performance Overheads: Frameworks might add some overhead to the system due to their generic
  nature.

## Microframework

A Microframework, on the other hand, is a minimalistic one-feature framework. It provides only basic
functionalities centered in a feature domain, leaving advanced features to third-party libraries,
plugins, or frameworks.

### Advantages of Microframeworks

- Simplicity: Microframework is straightforward to understand. They leave much of the design and
  structure decisions to the developer.
- Small Size and Performance: Microframeworks are lightweight and thus have less impact on the
  performance of an application.

### Disadvantages of Microframeworks

- Limited Functionality: Microframework provides fewer functionalities out of the box than
  full-featured frameworks.

## Why Graphane is a Microframework

Graphane is a microframework that reflects the framework's fine-grained, minimalistic approach to
data visualization architecture. This does not mean that Graphane is not capable or streamlined, but
rather that it provides a thin layer of fundamental features and leaves a lot of the decision-making
and architecture up to the developer.

### Simplicity

One of the main reasons Graphane is considered a microframework is its simplicity. It is designed to
be effortless to learn and use, providing only the fundamental tools needed to build a web
application.

### Flexibility

Microframeworks like Graphane value flexibility, allowing developers more control over their
applications. This way, developers are free to choose the application framework, libraries and tools
that best fit their project instead of being forced to use a single standard.

### Lightweight

Being a microframework, Graphane is very light on system resources. The less code makes the
application run quicker and uses less memory, which is vital in a production environment.

### Modularity

Graphane promotes modularity, meaning developers can easily plug in and remove components as needed.
This makes Graphane adaptable and perfect for projects where requirements are likely to change.

### Separation of Concerns

Crucial to the appeal of Graphane is its promotion of separation of concerns. This ensures that each
part of an application has a particular role and is responsible for a specific function.

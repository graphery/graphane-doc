Graphane is based on SVG and directives, defining a <strong>declarative way</strong> to build <strong>data-driven</strong> graphics. This approach allows centering the effort on the design in a very natural form. Designers and developers achieve technical efficiency and gain the means to communicate their data story to their audience effectively.</p><p>In addition, Graphane has a <strong>smooth rendering</strong> and <strong>optimal performance</strong> with a <strong>tiny overhead</strong>. It is not just a tool but a complete system that includes specially designed mechanisms to update the visualization efficiently when data are changed. This feature allows Graphane to maintain high runtime performance without the need for pre-compilation processes.</p><blockquote><p>For more details, see <a href="./../in-depth/architecture/why.html">Why Graphane?</a>.</p></blockquote>',6),o=[n];function s(d,h,c,l,p,m){return a(),t("div",null,o)}const f=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
